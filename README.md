Py2Gcode
========

This package was debeloped to produce for non conventional aplications. Especialy the control of printers with seringe pump extruders. This debelopment was heavily influenced by the mecode library (if you see some resamblens) by jminardi. And other inspiration was the turtle style

The usage of this package is not restricted to seringe pump based printers, in more general sense is a interface between python and Gcode

Quick start
-----------
To start we have to initiate the library calling py2gcode. The two important parametres to initalize this pachage are the initial diameter of your material and the desired diameter of the filament exiting the nozzle.
